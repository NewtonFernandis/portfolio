- Spearheaded the development of the Trends View feature, which incorporated a dynamic graph display alongside patient vital values on the patient listing screen. This configurable feature significantly enhanced user insights by providing graphical representations of key metrics such as Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), and Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2).
- Improved the performance of the Trends View feature by optimizing how data is fetched and displayed. Instead of making multiple requests to the server for graph data, I proposed a solution to generate the graphs on the server side and include them in the same data response. This approach reduced the load time by 20.8% and lowered the strain on the computerâ€™s processor by 38.4%.
- Contributed significantly to the Care @ Home project by creating a dynamic form \* driven by configurations, enabling patients to seamlessly share their medical history.
- Played a pivotal role in the codebase enhancement through rigorous refactoring, specifically targeting state management and API querying for increased efficiency and scalability.
- Engineered a feature within the Service Provider project enabling clinicians to track the status of specific orders, enhancing workflow visibility and efficiency.
- Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the same project, ensuring secure access and streamlined permissions management.
- Successfully integrated a notification system , enhancing user engagement and facilitating real-time updates within the platform.
